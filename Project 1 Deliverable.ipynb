    "Independent coffee shops face significant competition from Starbucks and other major brands.  To this end, CUPS (**the Client**) has designed a mobile app serving the NYC coffee scene, offering a mobile payment and discovery platform for many independent coffee shops around the area.  By purchasing varied monthly subscription plans, users can opt to enjoy a set number of coffee/tea beverages, or pay a flat fee for unlimited monthly drinks.\n",
